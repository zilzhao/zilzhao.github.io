I'm a third-year master's student from [LIESMARS](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).<br>
**Supervisor:** *Prof.* [Luliang Tang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/tangluliang),  *Prof.* [Qingquan Li](http://saup.szu.edu.cn/info/1091/1416.htm).<br>

  The rapid development of mobile positioning and computing technologies has led to massive *Geographic big data*, creating unprecedented opportunities for urban sensing. My research utilizes **geographic big data** (especially trajectory data) to address problems in **human mobility** and **complex urban transport systems** by developing innovative **geospatial analytical methods**.
  
  My research is devoted to addressing three main characteristics of geographic big data: **High-dimensional**, **Non-linear**, and **High-dynamic**.
  - *High-dimensional*: We combine **GIScience methods** with **Tensor Theory** to deal with high-dimensional spatio-temporal field data.
  - *Non-linear*: We combine **GIScience methods** with **Deep Learning** (e.g., Transformer) to re-veal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data.
  - *High-dynamic*: We break through the two-point form (origin-destination) for flow characterization and innovatively propose **Path Flow**.
