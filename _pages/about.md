I'm a third-year master's student from [LIESMARS](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).<br>
Advisor: *Prof.* [Luliang Tang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/tangluliang).

  The rapid development of mobile positioning and computing technologies has led to massive *Geographic Big Data*, creating unprecedented opportunities for *Urban Sensing*. My research utilizes *geographic big data* (especially trajectory data) to address problems in *human mobility* and *complex urban transport systems* by developing innovative *geospatial analytical methods*.
  
  My research is devoted to addressing three main characteristics of geographic big data: **High-dimensional**, **Non-linear**, and **High-dynamic**.
  - *High-dimensional*: We combine **GIScience methods** with **Tensor Theory** to deal with high-dimensional spatio-temporal field data.
  - *Non-linear*: We combine **GIScience methods** with **Deep Learning** (e.g., Transformer) to reveal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data.
  - *High-dynamic*: We break through the two-point form (origin-destination) for flow characterization and innovatively propose **Path Flow**.
