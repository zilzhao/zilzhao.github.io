Community shuttle services have the potential to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce traffic pollution caused by massive short-distance taxi-hailing trips. In this study, we developed a novel method to adaptively generate shuttle stops with maximum service capacity based on residents’ origin–destination (OD) data, and designed shuttle routes with minimum mileage by genetic algorithm. For traffic congestion alleviation, we identified trips that can be shifted to shuttle services and their potential changes in traffic flow. The decrease in traffic flow can alleviate traffic congestion and indirectly reduce unnecessary pollutant emissions. We utilized the COPERT III model and the spatial kernel density estimation method to finely analyze the reduction in traffic emissions by eco-friendly transportation modes to support detailed policymaking regarding transportation environmental issues.
