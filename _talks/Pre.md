## Turn-level traffic flow sensing and prediction technology based on spatio-temporal trajectory big data fusion
  *Core researcher and developer*, Funded by *Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (No. YBN2018095106)*, 2020.05-2021.12 <br>
  * Develop a spatio-temporal analysis empowered low-rank tensor completion method for traffic data imputation, by considering the continuity, periodicity and transitivity of traffic flow.
  * Construct a ‘segment-turn’ based traffic topology graph (named dyadic graph), and develop a fine-grained traffic prediction method with graph attention network to achieve turn-level prediction of traffic states.<br>

## AI-based key technology for unmanned inspection of extra-high arch dams
  *Core developer*, Funded by *HuaNeng Lancang river hydropower INC. (No. XWDC2020/P26)*, 2021.01-2022.12 <br>
  * Propose a UAV trajectory planning method for complex scenes of extra-high arch dams, which accounts for multiple constraints such as positioning signal, dam segment design, flight duration, and acquisition accuracy.
  * Develop a collaborative acquisition technology for dam surface data from UAV swarms considering the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of GNSS signals from arch dams.
  * Patent application: A trajectory planning method for automatic inspection operation of extra-high arch dams by UAV (No. 202111411213X)<br>

## Warehouse picking problems in large scale and complex scenarios
  *Project Leader*, Funded by *Jingdong Logistics* and *DC Holdings*, 2020.03-2022.08 <br>
  * Propose the concept of replacement recheck table and construct a dynamic adjustment algorithm applicable to multi-zone type warehouse and complex picking problems.
  * Combined with the specific situation of enterprise logistics warehouse picking, realize multi-perspective and whole process of warehouse picking path optimization.<br>
