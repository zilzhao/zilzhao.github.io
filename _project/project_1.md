## AI-based key technology for unmanned inspection of extra-high arch dams, 2021.01-2022.12
  *Core developer*, funded by HuaNeng Lancang river hydropower INC. (No. XWDC2020/P26)<br>
  * Propose a UAV trajectory planning method for complex scenes of extra-high arch dams, which accounts for multiple constraints such as positioning signal, dam segment design, flight duration, and acquisition accuracy.
  * Develop a collaborative acquisition technology for dam surface data from UAV swarms considering the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of GNSS signals from arch dams.
  * Patent application: A trajectory planning method for automatic inspection operation of extra-high arch dams by UAV (No. 202111411213X)
