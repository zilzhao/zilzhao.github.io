 • Proposes a new method for road crowd-sensing with high spatio-temporal resolution based on static infrastructure 'form' and dynamic activity behavior 'flow'.<br>
 • From the perspective of static road network 'form', the method takes 'point-line-surface-body' elements as the research context, and constructs a theoretical system of high-precision road map crowd-sensing.<br>
 • In terms of activity behavior 'flow', we break through the limitations of traditional point pattern analysis and develop a spatio-temporal modeling and multi-scale analysis method for spatial activity flow.<br>
