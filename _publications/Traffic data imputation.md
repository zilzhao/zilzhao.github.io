*Funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities*<br>
•	Propose a complete framework to quantitatively assess the positive impacts of community shuttle services.<br>
•	Develop a novel method to adaptively generate shuttle stops with maximum service capacity based on crowd movement data, and design shuttle routes with minimum mileage by genetic algorithm.<br>
•	Conduct a fine-grained quantitative assessment of the extent to which community shuttle services alleviate traffic congestion and reduce traffic-related air pollution.<br>
