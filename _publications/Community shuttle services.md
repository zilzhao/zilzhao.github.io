*Funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFB0503604)*<br>
•	Adopt a manifold embedding approach to depict the local geometric structure of spatio-temporal domains, and propose a novel Spatio-Temporal constrained Low-Rank Tensor Completion (ST-LRTC) method.<br>
•	The proposed method achieves stable and accurate imputation results even in extreme scenarios with large missing rates or non-random missing patterns.<br>
•	This study won the **Grand Prize** of the *12th National College Students' Science and Technology Thesis Competition on Surveying and Mapping*; **Excellent Bachelor's Thesis** of *Wuhan University (2021)*.<br>
