Research Framework

ðŸ“ƒ **Motivation 1:** How to characterize massive, **high-dimensional** geographic big data? <br>

ðŸ“ƒ **Motivation 2:** How to capture the **intrinsic nonlinear** characteristics of geographic big data? <br>

ðŸ“ƒ **Motivation 3:** How to characterize the **high-dynamic** activity flow of geographic big data? <br>

To address these issues, my research includes:
  - **High-dimensional**: We combine *GIScience methods* with *Tensor Theory* to deal with high-dimensional spatio-temporal field data.
  - **Non-linear**: We combine *GIScience methods* with *Deep Learning* (e.g., Transformer) to re-veal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data.
  - **High-dynamic**: We break through the two-point form (origin-destination) for flow characterization and innovatively propose *Path Flow*.
