Research Framework
======
‚ùì **Motivation 1:** How to characterize massive, **high-dimensional** geographic big data? <br>

‚ùì **Motivation 2:** How to capture the **intrinsic nonlinear** characteristics of geographic big data? <br>

‚ùì **Motivation 3:** How to characterize the **high-dynamic** activity flow of geographic big data? <br>

To address these issues, my research includes:

‚úîÔ∏è **High-dimensional**: We combine *GIScience methods* with *Tensor Theory* to deal with high-dimensional spatio-temporal field data.

‚úîÔ∏è **Non-linear**: We combine *GIScience methods* with *Deep Learning* (e.g., Transformer) to re-veal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data.

‚úîÔ∏è **High-dynamic**: We break through the two-point form (origin-destination) for flow characterization and innovatively propose *Path Flow*.

------
  A high-dimensional tensor is a desirable representation of spatiotemporal field data with multi-dimensionality, such as traffic speed data.
  - Incorporating *tensor models* into *geospatial analysis* provides a better way to deal with spatiotemporal field data, reveal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data, and capture interdependencies in multiple dimensions.
  - The incorporation of *geographic thinking* endows *tensor models* with explicit representations of spatiotemporal patterns, thereby facilitating the practical application of high-dimensional analytical methods in real scenarios, such as urban perception and pattern analysis.

  üèïÔ∏è **Urban Traffic Data Imputation:** Adopt a manifold embedding approach to depict the local geometric structure of spatio-temporal domains, and propose a novel Spatio-Temporal constrained Low-Rank Tensor Completion (ST-LRTC) method.
  üèïÔ∏è **Urban Traffic Anomaly Diagnosis:** A novel Spatio-Temporal constrained Low-Rank Sparse Tensor (ST-LRST) method is proposed to decompose urban traffic data into normal and anomalous components.
