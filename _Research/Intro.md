‚ùì **Motivation 1:** How to characterize massive, **high-dimensional** geographic big data? <br>

‚ùì **Motivation 2:** How to capture the **intrinsic nonlinear** characteristics of geographic big data? <br>

‚ùì **Motivation 3:** How to characterize the **high-dynamic** activity flow of geographic big data? <br>

  To address these issues, my research includes:

‚úîÔ∏è **High-dimensional**: We combine *GIScience methods* with *Tensor Theory* to deal with high-dimensional spatio-temporal field data.

‚úîÔ∏è **Non-linear**: We combine *GIScience methods* with *Deep Learning* (e.g., Transformer) to re-veal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data.

‚úîÔ∏è **High-dynamic**: We break through the two-point form (origin-destination) for flow characterization and innovatively propose *Path Flow*.

------
  A high-dimensional tensor is a desirable representation of spatiotemporal field data with multi-dimensionality, such as traffic speed data.<br>
  - Incorporating *tensor models* into *geospatial analysis* provides a better way to deal with spatiotemporal field data, reveal the intrinsic structure of complex spatio-temporal data, and capture interdependencies in multiple dimensions.
  - The incorporation of *geographic thinking* endows *tensor models* with explicit representations of spatiotemporal patterns, thereby facilitating the practical application of high-dimensional analytical methods in real scenarios, such as urban perception and pattern analysis.

  üèïÔ∏è **Urban Traffic Data Imputation:** Adopt a manifold embedding approach to depict the local geometric structure of spatio-temporal domains, and propose a novel Spatio-Temporal constrained Low-Rank Tensor Completion (ST-LRTC) method.<br>

  Fine-grained traffic forecasting is crucial for the planning and management of urban transportation systems.<br>
  
  üó∫Ô∏è **Complex Urban Traffic Forecasting:** Most current approaches concentrate on point-based and grid-based forecasts, ignoring the real bidirectional-road-based network structure.

  üó∫Ô∏è **Integrated and Fine-grained Traffic Forecasting:** Road segments and intersection turns, as vital elements of road networks, exhibit diverse spatial structures, yet their traffic states are interconnected due to spatial proximity.

Path flow
------
  The original OD flow's representation of trip's start and end points lacks the portrayal of trajectories/individual travel behaviors, and does not fully exploit the trajectory/travel information.<br>
  
  üö∂ **Modeling:** Path flow is a high-dimensional flow structure based on all the road segments passed by the user's travel trajectory in the road network space.
  - ***Zilong Zhao***, Hongyu Shi, Luliang Tang, Zihan Kan, Mei-Po Kwan. From OD flow to Path flow: Flow Representation and Pattern Mining for Trajectory Big Data. To be submitted to *International Journal of Geographical Information Science*.

  üö∂ **Sustainability:** Massive personal short-distance trips impose certain travel costs on travelers, cause considerable stress on road traffic, and degrade the surrounding environment. Constructing shuttle services and encouraging residents to shift travel patterns from private modes to shuttle services may reduce traffic pressure and further provide cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation for citizens.

  üö∂ **Resilience:** The traditional way of using a single point to characterize the whole complex intersection cannot finely reflect the dynamic information of intersections. We upgrade the evaluation scale of intersections to turn level, propose intersection TSN, and achieve a refined and dynamic evaluation of urban intersections.
